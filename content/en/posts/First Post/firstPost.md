As I sit here looking at my website going live for the first time I am overwhelmed with the possibilities this could lead to. One of my goals has been to create a blog sites and write about my interest, but now I am faced with the overwhelming question of what to write about and will anyone read it. Well in times of doubt I am reminded of a quote from the movie Field of Dreams - "If you build it they will come." and that is exactly what I plan on doing, I will build this blog up for all to see.
