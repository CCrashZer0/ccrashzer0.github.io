A jack of all trades and a master of none, but often times better then a master of one. -- William Shakespeare

This quote has always resonated with me and I find its perfect for introducing myself.
Hi, I'm CCrashZer0, you could describe me as a cyber security enthusiast, ethical hacker, mentor, and maker. My passions has many depths, whether it's security research, developing scripts, 3d printing, or accepting a new challenges.  Iâ€™m always looking to expand my knowledge and skill set, so it isnt uncommon to find me listening to a podcast while I am in my lab solving challenges on platforms like TryHackMe or HackTheBox but you could just as easy find me jamming out to some music and tinkering with one of my 3d printers.
