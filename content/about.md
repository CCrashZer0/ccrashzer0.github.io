Hi,I’m CCrashZer0, you could call me a cybersecurity enthusiast, ethical hacker, mentor, and maker. My passions run deep and wide, whether I’m diving into security research, developing scripts, or exploring the world of 3D printing. I love getting my down into the nitty-gritty of a new challange.

I’m always on a mission to expand my knowledge and sharpen my skills. You’ll often find me in my lab, solving challenges on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox — usually with a podcast playing in the background. But just as easily, you might catch me jamming to music while fine-tuning a 3D printer.
