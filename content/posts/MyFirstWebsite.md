I’m still wrapping my head around this. The fact that I’ve successfully deployed my own website. This has been a long-standing goal of mine ever since I discovered the world of cyber security. Well it is finally time for me to carve out my own little corner of the internet. A space where I can share my thoughts, document what I’m working on, and dive into the research I’m passionate about.

Now that my site is live, I’m still figuring out how best to use it. My first idea? To turn it into a central hub for all my old CTF (Capture The Flag) write-ups. It feels like a great starting point, not only to showcase my past work but also to create a resource for others in the community.

There’s still so many things that I plan to do, build, study, but what I’m excited about is that the journey ahead is just the beginning.
