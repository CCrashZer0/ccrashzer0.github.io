A maker coin is a simple yet affected way to show off your creativity and design skills and with a little ingenuity it can easily become a networking opportunity. So when I decided to create my first maker coin I wanted to go about it a different way and see if I could leverage the power of AI to bring my idea to reality.
The first thing I needed to do was figure out the dimensions of my design. Surprisingly enough I had just the item laying around that I wanted to base my design on.

After taking some measurements from my poker chip, coming up with the color palette that I wanted to use, and the general theme of the maker coin. I headed over to ChatGPT to see if it could take all of this from concept to reality. Here is how it went.

## Step 1: Concept Development

I stated with a simple idea. I wanted a cyberpunk themed chip. I believed this concept to be minimal but bold. The color palette I ended up settled on was light blue, black, and white. 
My first prompt was to instruct ChatGPT to act as a professional graphic designer and help me come up with my first sketch.

"Act as a professional graphics designer. I want you to help me create a maker coin. This design should be in a circular layout mimicking a poker chip, the background should be a circuit board style line art, there should be two rings (one inside, one outside) that have an alternating block pattern, lastly the center of the chip should contain the text **CC0**"

After a few revisions I finally settled on a design that I like. I was quite pleased with everything so far. Something that would normally take days now only takes me a couple of hours.

## Step 2: Vector Conversion 

Now that I had a final image, the next step was to convert it into a vector graphic. I know that I wanted this model to support multicolored printing. So ensuring that each item could be carefully separated into individual shape was essential to this design.
Since I know that I was going to be using TinkerCAD at some point I decided that the best format to use was an SVG. 

## Step 3: Generating the STL for 3D Printing

The final step was transforming the design into a 3D-printable STL file. ChatGPT assisted by taking the image and generating a height map to extrude the shapes as raised features. I got an STL with the full chip layout, including distinct layers ready for color slicing in tools like Prusa Slicer, Bambu Studio and Orca

If I wanted to produce a multicolor version, I could simply print in layers or use a multi-material printer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Reflections on the Process

Designing a maker coin with AI felt like having a creative collaborator on call 24/7. I could describe changes, test design ideas, and even get STL-ready code and files without opening a dozen software apps.

What surprised me most was how well AI handled the transition between 2D concept art and 3D modeling. With a few prompts, I could turn an idea into a physical object‚Äîready to print and share.

Whether you're a maker, designer, or hobbyist, AI tools like ChatGPT and image generators can seriously streamline your creative workflow. This project was just one example‚Äîbut the potential is limitless.
