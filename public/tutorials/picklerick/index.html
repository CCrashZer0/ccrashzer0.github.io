<p>A good rule of thumb is to start by scanning your machine for any open ports.<br>
Command: <code>nmap -T4 -sC -sV -A -p- 10.10.82.95</code><br>
Command Breakdown:</p>
<pre><code>-T4: speed of nmap scan is 4/5 (personal preference of mine)

-sC: Scan with default NSE scripts. Considered useful for discovery and safe

-sV: Attempts to determine the version of the service running on port

-A: do an extensive scan on these ports

-p-: Scann all ports
</code></pre>

<p>Port 22- ssh</p>
<p>Here we are able to see that our SSH port is open. This port isn&rsquo;t too vulnerable unless we have found someones credentials. Se we will not mess with it.</p>
<p>Port 80- http</p>
<p>It is here were we find a webservice. Lets poke around and see if there is anyting interesting.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/webService.png">
</figure>

<p>It looks as if we have a web page. It also seems that Rick really does need our help.<br>
Checking out the source code of a page can reveal all sorts of things.
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/sourceCode.png">
</figure>

Great it looks like we have found a user name. Lets take note of that and keep digging, maybe we will get lucky and find the password.</p>

<p>We are going to be using gobuster to try and locate any directories that may have been hidden from us.<br>
Command: <code>gobuster -u http://10.10.82.95 -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,sh, txt,cgi,html,css,js,py</code></p>
<p>Command Breakdown:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    -u: Full URL (including scheme), or base domain name.

	-w: Path to the wordlist used for brute forcing (use – for stdin).

    -x: List of extensions to check for, if any.  
</code></pre><figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/gobusterResults.png">
</figure>

<p>It looks like GoBuster was able to find a few directories for us.<br>
How about we go and check out the login.php.
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/login.png">
</figure>
</p>
<p>Eariler we found a username but at this moment we still do not have a password.<br>
Most websites will have a robots.txt file that will tell a browser what is and isn&rsquo;t allowed to index. So lets see if there is one for this site.<br>
Success! It seems that there is a robots.txt for this site and in that file is a very obvious reference to the show Rick and Morty! Lets try this and see if it our password.
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/robots.png">
</figure>

YES! We where able to get loged in and we where brought to the command portal.
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/commandPortal.png">
</figure>

Now since this page is called the command portal lets try and actually enter in some command and see what happens.<br>
If we enter in the ls command we can see that some results are being returned. It would seem that we have also found our first ingredient.
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/lsCommand.png">
</figure>

I wonder if we can access the Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt the same way we did our robots.txt file. So in my browser I just went to the following page <code>http://&lt;ipAddress&gt;/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt</code> and what do you know we now have the content of that text file. One down two to go!<br>

</h2>
<p>We are now one ingredient. It is time to find the other two but where do we start looking.<br>
Lets go back to our command portal and us the ls command again. We see that there is a file call clue.txt, how about we open it up and see if there is anything useful in it.<br>
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/clue.png">
</figure>

Maybe it is just me but the words file system seem to jump out at me. So lets go to the command portal and use <code>ls /home</code>.<br>
This will list out everyting in our home directory.. and would you lookie there is a dictory called rick. Lets keep digging and use <code>ls /home/rick</code> and within the rick dicectory we have a file called <code>second ingredients</code>.<br>
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/rickDir.png">
</figure>

I wonder if it is posible for us to use the <code>cat</code> command to receive the content of the second ingredient. Well lets try.<br>
It looks like we are getting an error telling us that the command we used has been disabled.<br>

<p>I tried every command that I could think of and each of them always got me right back to the same command disabled page. So I had to reach out to my dear old friend agent Google to try and find out if there was an alternative command to cat.
It toke sometime but I was able to find a nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_%28Unix%29"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wikipedia</a> artical on the <code>less</code> command.<br>
Now we pull the trigger and see if this command will work for us.<br>
Command: <code>less '/home/rick/second ingredients'</code><br>
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/ing2.png">
</figure>

Well HOT HAM! That acutlly worked and we now have the second ingredient.<br>
Now that we know the <code>less</code> command will work for us we just need to track down the thrid and final ingredient.<br>
Lets see if we are able to use <code>ls</code> and get into the <code>/root</code> directory. It seems that we are not able to view anything in from the <code>/root</code>.. I wonder if if we are able to use <code>sudo</code> to elevated our user prevlages.<br>
Command: <code>sudo -l</code><br>
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/sudo.png">
</figure>

WHAT!!! We are able to combine sudo with any command and not get prompted for a password. This may be just what we need in order to see what is in the <code>/root</code> directory. We will just need to combine sudo and ls to see what all is in that directory.<br>
Command: <code>sudo ls /root</code>
<figure><img src="/images/PickleRick/sudoRoot.png">
</figure>

Now that we have found the location of the third ingredient we are going to use our dear friend <code>less</code> to receive the contents of it, but remember since we are in the root directory we will need to add <code>sudo</code> to the front of our command. <br>
Command: <code>sudo less /root/3rd.txt</code><br>
