        <p>Creating a blog has been on my bucket list for several years. When I was younger, I used to write on various sites about a range of different topics. It really was an outlet for me, a way for me to escape form the day-to-day and it allowed me to express myself freely, and without concern.</p>
<p>But here we are years later and I feel like I&rsquo;ve forgotten how to actually write a blog. Every time I try, I get stuck in this endless loop of perfectionism, obsessing over every sentence, every detail, until I lose all motivation I started with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how this can happen. When you&rsquo;re younger you can create without fear, whether it&rsquo;s writing, coding, or building something new. You don&rsquo;t worry about if something is &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; But as you gain experience, the expectations grow, and suddenly, what use to be an enjoyable process now become a struggle to meet this invisible standard.
In the short time since starting this blog I have realized that I need to break free from that mindset. Writing shouldn&rsquo;t be about perfection, It should be about sharing ideas, documenting thought, and enjoying the process as thing unravel. So instead of over analyzing every single post. I am choosing to just write. To let my word flow freely. embracing my imperfections, and rediscovering what made me what to blog in the first place.</p>
<p>This blog isn&rsquo;t just going to be about cyber security or tech, it is also about the journey. If you have ever struggled with creative roadblocks or the pressure to be perfect, you are not alone. Let&rsquo;s figure this out together, one post at a time.</p>
