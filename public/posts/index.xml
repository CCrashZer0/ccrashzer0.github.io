      <description>One of the questions I get asked pretty often is: “How did you get into this line of work?”&#xA;Well, if I’m being completely honest… it all happened by accident. You see I’ve always had an interest in computers and loved figuring out how things worked, but cyber security was never really on my radar. Originally, I wanted to become a digital artist and design immersive, realistic levels for video games.</description>

      <description>Creating a blog has been on my bucket list for several years. When I was younger, I used to write on various sites about a range of different topics. It really was an outlet for me, a way for me to escape form the day-to-day and it allowed me to express myself freely, and without concern.&#xA;But here we are years later and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten how to actually write a blog.</description>

      <description>I’m still wrapping my head around this. The fact that I’ve successfully deployed my own website. This has been a long-standing goal of mine ever since I discovered the world of cyber security. Well it is finally time for me to carve out my own little corner of the internet. A space where I can share my thoughts, document what I’m working on, and dive into the research I’m passionate about.</description>

      <description>February 4 was a day of silence and sorrow as I received the heartbreaking news that Don from NovaSpirit Tech had passed away after his battle with cancer.&#xA;Though I never had the privilege of knowing Don personally, his channel played a significant role in shaping my journey as a maker. His passion, creativity, and willingness to share his knowledge helped me nurture and develop my own skills, both as a hobbyist and a professional.</description>

      <description>As I sit here looking at my website going live for the first time I am overwhelmed with the possibilities this could lead to. One of my goals has been to create a blog sites and write about my interest, but now I am faced with the overwhelming question of what to write about and will anyone read it. Well in times of doubt I am reminded of a quote from the movie Field of Dreams - &amp;ldquo;If you build it they will come.</description>
