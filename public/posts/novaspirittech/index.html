        <p>February 4 was a day of silence and sorrow as I received the heartbreaking news that Don from NovaSpirit Tech had passed away after his battle with cancer.</p>
<p>Though I never had the privilege of knowing Don personally, his channel played a significant role in shaping my journey as a maker. His passion, creativity, and willingness to share his knowledge helped me nurture and develop my own skills, both as a hobbyist and a professional.</p>
<p>Don’s selflessness and dedication to the tech community were truly inspiring. He made learning accessible to so many, and for that, I am forever grateful. My heart goes out to his family during this difficult time. I only wish there were more I could do beyond offering words of gratitude and encouragement.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, Don. Your legacy will live on in every project, every line of code, and every tinkerer you’ve inspired. And in your honor, we’ll all keep pushing boundaries, breaking barriers, and—of course—hacking till it Hertz.</p>
