      <description>Try Hack Me - RootMe A ctf for beginners, can you root me? Reconnaissance Scan the machine, how many ports are open? Here is the nmap scann commands that I am going to be using.
nmap -sC -sV -T4 -A -oN nmap/result &amp;lt;IP&amp;gt; Breakdown:
-A: do an extensive scan on these ports -sC: Scan with default NSE scripts. Considered useful for discovery and safe -sV: Attempts to determine the version of the service running on port -T4: speed of nmap scan is 4/5 (personal preference of mine) -oN: Normal output to the file normal.</description>
